"""Content-defined chunking (CDC) over token-ID sequences.

Boundaries depend only on the last ``WINDOW_SIZE`` tokens, not on absolute
position or anything upstream — the property RadixAttention's chained hash
lacks by design (see ``PIC_IRMINSUL.md`` Section 0). Used by
``ExactHashProvider`` to find donor spans independent of where they sit in
the current prompt.
