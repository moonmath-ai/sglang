"""E2E correctness test: does ExactHashProvider's shifted-offset reuse
produce numerically consistent output vs. a fresh full recompute?

This is deliberately *not* a reuse of
``test_input_output_logprobs_match_prefill_cache_hit_helper`` — that helper
tests exact-prefix content reused at the *same* offset (today's ordinary
RadixCache behavior). This test constructs the actual scenario
``PIC_IRMINSUL.md`` is about: content registered as a donor at one absolute
position, found and RoPE-corrected when it reappears at a *different*
position in a later, unrelated prompt.

Scenario construction is deliberate, not arbitrary, because of how content-
defined chunking lines up boundaries (documented in POC_PLAN.md):
``ExactHashProvider`` extends a match through *consecutive* chunks of the
unmatched tail (POC_PLAN.md Stage 2's multi-chunk follow-up), but each chunk
still only matches a registered chunk when it's chunked identically on both
the registration and query side — which requires the registration prefix to
be exactly ``SINK_TOKENS`` long (so ``chunk_region_start`` lands exactly at
the donor content's start) and the query prefix to be *fully* exact-matched
beforehand (so the unmatched tail is exactly the donor content, chunked
fresh from its own start). Real CDC boundaries depend on the preceding
``WINDOW_SIZE`` tokens of context, not just the donor content itself, so
without this alignment the boundaries silently diverge between the
registration and query side. Real, un-arranged traffic won't reliably line
up this way yet — see POC_PLAN.md's Stage 1 follow-up notes.

Donor/query content is **synthetic random token IDs**, not real dataset text
(e.g. LongBench, used by the sibling KL tests). An earlier version used real
LongBench-v2 samples and got spurious `cached_tokens` hits with no
`[FUZZY RADIX]`/`[EXACT_HASH]` log line ever firing — LongBench-v2 entries
frequently share source documents across different questions, so two
samples drawn from "different" indices in the pool aren't guaranteed to be
non-overlapping content, which is exactly what this test needs to control
for precisely. Random token IDs make non-overlap essentially certain and
are fine for a pure numerical self-consistency check — the KL comparison is
between two computations of the same thing, not a judgment about text
quality.
